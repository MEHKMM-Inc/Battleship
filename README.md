# Battleship

The goal of this project is to build a functional assistant for the game Battleship. You will still get to make your own decisions while playing but
this program will tell you where it thinks you should attack based on where your previous attacks are and the outcomes of them. This program
will also have a UI that shows you the side of the board that you are attacking.
