If it dosent work, try these steps:
1. Open the project in visual studio
2. Run the maven command "clean"
3. Run the maven command "complie"
4. Run the maven command "package"
5. Open the generated file and there should be a `.war` that will be added as a deplotment on tomcat

To run maven commands, right click the maven project and select "run maven commands"
When adding the `.war` as a deployment, choose file and not exploded.
